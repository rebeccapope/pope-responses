How does Hart-Davison alter your perspective on a technical communicator’s role in an organization?
I wouldn’t say Hart-Davison altered my perspective much, but he did give a more in depth view of how technical communicators can and do fit into content management and organizations’ content management systems. In our earlier readings, notably Dicks (2010), the authors mostly talk about how technical communicators need to be aware of CM or find ways into working with CMS. The other authors were saying, “Technical communicators need to do this!” That’s fine, but Hart-Davison explains the how.
The other helpful part of Hart-Davison’s perspective is that he reassures the reader that though others in the technical communication field think that single sourcing, which is a driving force of CM, is a threat to technical writers, there are plenty of ways for us to fit into ever evolving CMS. He explains that not everyone in an organization has a writing background or knows how best to organize information, and that’s where technical communicators fit in. I have personally seen how people without writing or TC backgrounds can make communicating information across a small company difficult. The people who were in charge of keeping track of documentation either had no management system or didn’t even track important information.
Hart-Davison gives me ideas for employment beyond writing manuals and editing protocols to help companies pass document audits, which was my previous experience. Instead of just generating content, which almost anyone can do these days with the Web, I can help manage the content so that it can be retrieved easier. I know I can organize paper files; I’m hoping now I can learn how to organize electronic data for better retrieval. I know I won’t need to go scrounging around other departments for file cabinets for more storage as the company expands as I did back in 2009.
