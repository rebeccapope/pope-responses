		<h2>Clark and Anderson response</h2>
		<p>Most of the article talks about how TC thinks too much about tools and non-specific end users. Clark and Anderson believe that technical communicators need to view their work and tools from management's perspective. Only if technical communicators work with internal users--management and subject matter experts--can they demonstrate their usefulness within an organization. If technical communicators can't convince management of their importance, they probably will see their jobs outsourced, if not eliminated.</p>
		
		<p>Anderson and Clark also talk about <q>technology as a tool,</q> where users are in control of a technology they can use to make a useful product. This is fine, they argue, but TC needs to teach students that problems they're asked to solve have larger contexts within and outside of a company. They need to know and understand the more complicated politics behind why the problem exists and what limitations exist on solving the problem, such as budget, time, and other resources. TC needs to widen its scope so that practitioners can demonstrate how they can contribute more than just knowledge of how to use a specific program to make a document or webpage. They need to show that they are proactive about technology rather than reactive, are on the cutting edge and up to date on other buzzwords management is so fond of.</p>

		<p>As for XML, Anderson and Clark talk about how it needs a context for it to make sense. For a technical communicator to build a website, database, etc. in XML, she has to find out how the information tagged in XML is going to be used. This means she has to interview or at least talk to the internal end users to find out the best way to markup data for the final product. What the technical communicator may think is important may not be what management or the subject matter experts think is important.</p>
