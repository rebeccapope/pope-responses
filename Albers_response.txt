I don’t know if I would say that Albers’ article changed my perspective on this class or on my future as a technical communicator. Most of these articles we’ve read seem to reflect the doom and gloom outlook of the early 2000s before the economy crashed. I don’t get the sense that professionals in TC have the same outlook today.
I understand Albers’ view that a craftsman model of writing doesn’t work for TC. Writing needs organization and consistent style, but writing content for a company is too large of a task for a single person. Therefore, writing is a team endeavor, but the individual contributions can’t be slapped together with the hope the reader understands the resulting piece. Several people at the Boardroom Series a couple weeks ago talked about how they work with or as part of a team of technical writers rather than following the craftsman model.
I think that my perspective changed about web design rather than technical communication. When I first learned basic web design in 2001, the focus was on aesthetics rather than function or usability. With the articles and discussions in this class, I can look back and see how web design changed over the past 14 years. I like to think that technical communicators looked at the developing Internet and decided that TC could and would make it a far more useful communication tool than just hosting email or personal blogs.
After reviewing the GitHub introductory video, I get why we use the site for class. The first time I viewed it I focused on how to use the site rather than why to use it. I know from experience that version control is a hassle. I worked at two different plants where I checked the manuals in every department for the correct versions of documents. If I missed an outdated document, the company lost points on external compliance audits.
