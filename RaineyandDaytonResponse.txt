I was surprised at how web design has become a requirement for technical communicators. I always thought of web design as its own entity. The writer wrote the copy for the content, while a web designer managed the company website and uploaded the provided content. However, when I think back to the one web design class I took as an elective in high school and TECM 2700 last semester, the same principles of usability and design guided our projects. When I took the web design class, we worked in HTML. I never even heard of Frame Maker until I came across it while looking through job advertisements this summer.
I tried finding an internship or part time job this summer with no luck. Most of the job descriptions posted listed specific programs that were required of candidates, such as Frame Maker, Adobe Photoshop and InDesign, and Microsoft Publisher. Most jobs I had required Microsoft Word and Excel; everything else was unnecessary or used on rare occasions. I enrolled in TECM 5191 hoping to get some knowledge of and experience in the “new” programs required of job applicants in the technical communication field. Searching job boards scared me into thinking that I am woefully underprepared in my new career path. However, reading the Rainey and Dayton article gave me hope that I am smart enough to figure out how to learn new programs and tools as needed rather than spending hundreds of dollars on webinars and lectures to learn everything about a specific program’s version. Most people never use all the features in a program, even if they use it every day. Now if I could find a way to convince a hiring manager that I can figure out how to use software in a day or two, that would be perfect!
