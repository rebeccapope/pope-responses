<h1 style="color: blue">What is XLST, and why is it important to technical communicators?</h1>

<p>XSLT is a way to transform XML data into different formats depending on what the desired output is. Technical communicators can markup large amounts of data in XML and use XSLT to turn it into PDF, HTML, CSV, plain text, and differently formatted XML files. In some cases, the output needs to be available on the internet, so the XML data is transformed into HTML. A customer may need to export the data into a spreadsheet for editing or some other purpose, so XSLT can transform it into a CSV file. Maybe someone wants to print the data as a document, which is where transformation into PDF comes in.</p>

<p>XSLT helps technical communicators by saving them time. With XSLT, technical communicators don't need to create multiple documents; they only need to create one and properly use XSLT to transform it into multiple outputs. It can also be used to reformat data into another form of XML if one company or group uses different formatting than another. XSLT helps change the formatting without having to create a whole new XML file.</p>

<p>Technical communicators need to understand XML, XSLT, and the different outputs to implement XSLT correctly. They also need to understand their intended audience and their needs to determine which outputs will work best. XSLT helps technical communicators save time by using the same data to create multiple documents without having to create each one separately.</p>

<p>I know the assignment was to answer the question in 300 words, but I'm having a hard time making up the last 50 or so. I'm not too sure what else I can say without repeating myself or giving really obvious examples. The bottom line is that XSLT saves time and effort by turning a large data set in XML into multiple outputs depending on how the users or audience wants to use the data.</p>
